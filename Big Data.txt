The digital world is seeing a massive surge in data accumulation. Projections suggest that online data will account for 175 zettabytes by 2025. This leads to a heavy need to optimize storage and access to said data. The data comes from all over, an example is the Large Hadron Collider, its experiments produce around 50-75 petabytes each year along with satalites which produce around 23 terrabytes of data every day. When managing massive amounts of data, two main concerns are storage and processing efficiency. Storage solutions range from individual hard drives to massive data centers housing thousands of drives. Processing large datasets, like Twitter's 500 million daily tweets, requires efficient algorithms to avoid extended processing times. Ethics-wise, especially regarding data privacy and bias, are necessary when handling large amounts of personal or sensitive information.
