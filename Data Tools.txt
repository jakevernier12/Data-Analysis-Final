The world uses data collection for everything as we have extensively read in "Hello World." Companies find it imperative to maximize efficiency and organization with the worlds data. Data can be stored in different formats such as simple texts, spreadsheets, etc. SQL(Structured Query Language) is the most popular language for querying data sets. Data can also track trends which can provide insight for the future. With this module I learned how to use spreadsheets to analyze data and create graphs to help with visualization.
